	<h5>
		Adopting a cat is a big deal and takes a lot of effort. Before adopting a cat, you need to understand all the responsibilities. Cats needs constant care, attention, be fed and have play time. They need yearly checkups and need to get their annual shots. Vet checkups and shots can be very costly so it is very important to have a plan before adopting a cat. They also need a proper environment that fills their needs such as cat trees, scratching posts, toys, etc.<br>
<br>
		Before you adopt, make sure you have a room dedicated for the cat. When you bring the cat home, they would most likely hid due to the new environment. It would take some time for the cat to adjust and it is important to be patient. Don't rush with the interaction and take it slow. Cats would start to get comfortable in about a week. Staying in the room and being on your phone while not interacting with the cat can help them get comfortable with you. Try leaving the cat alone in the room so they get more comfortable. A litter box should be readily available in the room so the cat can use it. Food and water should be placed in the room as well. In the first week, the cat may not eat or drink as much which is completely normal and there is nothing to worry. It is important to have a schedule as cats tend to follow schedules. Try to give them food around the same time. Litter would need to be cleaned every day to ensure they use the litter box. <br><br><br>

	<h3 class="title">Things to have before adoption</h3>
    </div>

    <div style="padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px" class="col-12 text-center">
	<h5>
		Make sure to have a cat carrier so the new scared cat can be comfortable. <br>
		If you picked a cat already, ask what food they usually eat and buy plenty of that. It is essential to get what they are used to eating as new food can cause digestive issues. <br>
		Buy a food and water bowl or even a fountain if you are able to. <br>
		Buy a litter box and a non-clumping litter and have it set before you go to get the cat. <br>
		Try to have a cat bed to help make the cat comfortable.<br>
		Buy plenty of different toys. This is something that you can ask about too, to see if the cat has any favorite toys.<br><br><br>

	<h5>
		Treats can be great to use for bonding. <br>
		Buying a brush is important for grooming but not essential before adopting. You can get this later but it is recommended to get one. <br>
		Buying a scratching post can help stop cats from using furniture. It might not fully stop but can help lower the chances. <br><br><br>
